# Sprints Backend Summer Program
This repository contains the assignments and projects that I completed during the Sprints Backend Summer Program. The program aims to put learners on the path to a career in the backend development field. Learners are able to actively engage and learn by doing practical tasks and activities that allow them to develop and apply new skills and knowledge.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

1. **Assignments**: The `assignments` directory contains all the assignments that I completed during the program. Each assignment is contained in its own subdirectory, with a `README.md` file that describes the assignment and any additional files needed to complete it.

2. **Projects**: The `projects` directory contains all the projects that I completed during the program. Each project is contained in its own subdirectory, with a `README.md` file that describes the project and any additional files needed to run it.
